   Donkey Kong.
 - Donkey Kong Junior braves snapjaws, sparks and birds, throwing the key
   which will open Donkey Kong's locks, up to where his papa is held prisoner
 - avoid sparks overhead and make Junior jump and throw key to upper screen
 - when a snapjaw attacks, make Junior jump without hitting overhead spark
 - when Junior reaches the upper screen, he has to jump to get the key he
   threw again. The key jumps to one of the four locks

*Score:
 - when Junior jumps over a spark or snapjaw, score 1 point

 - when all four locks are opened, further 20 points are awarded
*When score reaches 300 points and there is one or two misses, one more Junior
 is added. If there are NO MISSES when a 300 points are reached, game goes
 into "CHANCE TIME". Score flashes and all points are awarded at double value
 until a MISS is scored.
